# Styles-Conference Website

As web designers and front-end developers, we have the luxury of attending a number of great conferences dedicated to our craft. This website was created for a fictional conference, Styles Conference, and was built following a number of modules led by [Shay Howe](https://github.com/shayhowe) via his [website](https://shayhowe.com/).
